<h1>What Data is Collected?</h1>
<p>Captured data is associated with a user through a combination of
workstation and workspace ids that are automatically generated by the
collector. This identification is not tied to any personal information
about the user.</p>
<p>The usage data monitors what is being used and when (timestamp),
including:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Loaded bundles</li>
	<li>Commands accessed via keyboard shortcuts</li>
	<li>Actions invoked via menus or toolbars</li>
	<li>Perspective changes</li>
	<li>View usage</li>
	<li>Editor usage</li>
</ol>
<p>Where possible, the usage data collector also capture the symbolic
name and version of the bundle contributing the
command/action/perspective/view/editor.</p>
